### **Requirments** 
- numpy >= 1.19
- pandas >= 1.0.1
- sckitlearn >= 0.22.0
- matplotlib >= 3.1.0
- pyreadr >= 0.4.0
- tensorflow == 2.5.0
- keres == 2.3.1






### **DATA** 

The initial raw daily data can be downloaded from [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15HG7-P5hUU8TtRmMDzY3_j_k-h_jyGwJ/view?usp=sharing). Caution this data set is very large about 330mb and consist of 3147312 rows and 14 colums. The data includes 1035 unique TIC id for firms.
Running the [Data_clean.py][Data_clean.py] will produce a clean pickle file namely daily_clear_ret.pickle with pandas data frame. 
The clean data shape is (928773, 27), with 25 features and TIC and CUSIP as identifying variable. 


### The Model
A Keras implementation of the Dy-Gap model proposed in the paper is presented in [Dy_Gap_Model.ipynb](Dy_Gap_Model.ipynb). 



###  Graph Evaluation and Statistics
The iPython Notebook [Figures_and_Statistics.ipynb](Figures_and_Statistics.ipynb) provide the related network statisitcs and their distribution. It also recreate some of the Figures from the paper.


###### The learned positive edges fromS&P-500 daily data. There are visible spikes in the degree of positive edges during financial, political, and economic events.

##### The network structure of S&P-500 stocks at different points of time. 
Green represents positive edges and red represents negative edges. During the normal economic condition, the market consists of a mixture of positive and negative edges. However, during the economic or political event, the network is dominated by positive edges, representing the commonality across firms.
